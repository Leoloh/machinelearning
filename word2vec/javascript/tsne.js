* This file contains an implementation of the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding algorithm
* It is used in order to reduce the dimensionality of data whilst preserving the higher dimensional similarities that exist.
* The algorithm can be found in this paper: http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf
